            Even when u are busy and have something to do<br>
            You know,<br>
            Every night i think of memories of you u know...<br>
            When we went to amplaz for valentine's<br>
            When we we went to solo<br>
            when we spent time together at cinema bakery<br>
            when we went to the zoo<br>
            when we moved your stuff to your new kos<br>
            when we went to prambanan hehe<br>
            though I guess that wasn't a date ya :p<br>
            and how happy you looked when you saw the snowglobe<br>
            and I also remember you when I gave you the edelweiss<br>
