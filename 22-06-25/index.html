    <h1>Hey honeyy &#x2764</h1>
    <p>Happy birthdayyyy!</p>
    <p>What a year yaa?</p>
    <p>I just want to say thank you, honeyy</p>
    <p>For all you’ve done this year.</p>
    <p>For staying with me.</p>
    <p>For being so kind and caring.</p>
    <p>For fighting through the mountains of challenges.</p>
    <p>For being so supportive and understanding.</p>
    <p>Truly, I’ve never met someone more caring, smart, hardworking, and of course, beautiful inside and out, than you.</p>
    <p>From me leaving Indo, to our long-distance phase, to me coming back, and now to this phase where we don’t have much time, but still, we find a way for it to work.</p>
    <p>I can’t imagine going through all of this with anyone else.</p>
    <p>I can’t imagine getting to this point with anyone else.</p>
    <p>I can’t imagine my life without you.</p>
    <p>So to you, honeyy. thank you for being <strong>you</strong> this year.</p>
    <p>And just know, you never <em>ever</em> are a burden to anyone…</p>
    <p>Because your presence is worth the world, tenfold.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 30px;">I love you honeyy, to Pluto and back.</p>
